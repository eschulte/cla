** TODO how best to present data to modules
Keeping in mind that the data set will change and we will want to
allow /incremental analysis/.

** TODO how best to pull data from modules
- call modules as functions, has the benefit of easy data transfer but
  makes it difficult for the module to persist data locally
- interact with the module through global variables
  - the front end pushes new information onto globally readable lists
  - each backend module updates an output variable readable by the
    front end on redisplay

** TODO how best to print the data
probably want to have two modes
1. incremental output of the results to the terminal using a library
   which is able to overwrite lines, thinking the format could allow
   one vertical segment (normally one line wide) to each module in
   which the incremental output is written. e.g.,
   :     min: x.xx
   :     max: x.xx
   :    mean: x.xx
   :   stdev: x.xx
   : pearson: x.xx
   :    poly: x + xX^x

* Examples
** Sine
#+begin_src sh
  for x in `seq 400`;do echo "s($x/100)"|bc -l; done
#+end_src
