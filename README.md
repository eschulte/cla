Command Line Analysis (CLA) --- !planning stages, not functional!
===========================

An extensible tool suite for general analysis from the command line.

This suite of tools enables exploratory data analysis from the command
line.  The `cla` executable accepts data through `STDIN`, feeds that
data to an easily extendable set of analytic modules, and outputs
their results to `STDOUT`.  The goal of the `cla` system is to provide
*no configuration required* data analysis ranging from simple means
and correlations to more sophisticated machine learning on the command
line for exploratory data analysis.
